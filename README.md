# portfolio-v2

My updated portfolio website, built with Next.js and tailwindcss. You can visit it at https://melidon.dev.

## Why another version?

My [previous portfolio](https://stavros-melidoniotis.github.io/) was built with HTML and vanilla CSS/JS and all of its content was static. Since I've  started learning React and improving my front-end skills, I wanted to build websites using these technologies and a new portfolio was the ideal project. This new version also integrates the Github and Spotify APIs to fetch my pinned repositories and my gists as well as let everyone know what song I'm currently listening to.

The portfolio is deployed on Vercel.
