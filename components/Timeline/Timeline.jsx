              My first full-time job! This was my chance to make good use of all
              the skills that I've gained during the previous years. I've
              participated in numerous projects, either alone or as part of a
              team, and every single one of them has provided me with even more
              skills and experience. Apart from writing code I also train new
              co-workers and guide them through all the initial stages.

              The time has come. My thesis project "Develop a Facebook Messenger
              chatbot that will operate as Harokopio University's undergraduate
              student advisor" was rated with 10/10, which allowed me to
              graduate from HUA with a GPA of 8.6/10, the highest grade at this
              specific graduation ceremony.
