              My first full-time job! This was my chance to make good use of all
              the skills that I&apos;ve gained during the previous years.
              I&apos;ve participated in numerous projects, either alone or as
              part of a team, and every single one of them has provided me with
              even more skills and experience. Apart from writing code I also
              train new co-workers and guide them through all the initial
              stages.
